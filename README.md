## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This%20starter%20configures%20Supabase%20Auth%20to%20use%20cookies%2C%20making%20the%20user's%20session%20available%20throughout%20the%20entire%20Next.js%20app%20-%20Client%20Components%2C%20Server%20Components%2C%20Route%20Handlers%2C%20Server%20Actions%20and%20Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png&integration-ids=oac_VqOgBHqhEoFTPzGkPd7L0iH6)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

Certainly! Here's how I might respond to the question about my greatest professional achievements:

One of my most significant professional achievements is developing a comprehensive social networking application entirely on my own. This project involved creating both the frontend and backend components, integrating various technologies to ensure a robust and scalable solution.

On the frontend, I used Next.js for server-side rendering and Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern design. For the backend, I utilized Supabase to handle authentication, database management, and real-time functionality. The database was powered by PostgreSQL, with pgpool used to manage connections and improve performance.

Building this application required not only technical skills but also a deep understanding of user experience and security. The successful deployment and positive feedback from users highlighted the effectiveness of the technologies and strategies I employed. This project stands out as a testament to my ability to independently manage a full-stack development process and deliver a high-quality product.
